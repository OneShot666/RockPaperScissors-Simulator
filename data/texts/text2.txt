What is an entity ?
---
Entities are the objects that move in the simulation.
They represent the original hand signs of the game.

Except this time, they move on their own and have a purpose :
To become the dominante 'species' !
These entities can seek a target and chase it until contact.
When this happens, the chased entity becomes its predator's type and is now part of the species.
This is instant and without any resistance.

Mutations :
- 30% : Can gain or lose a small amount of speed (±0.25)
- 30% : Can have their vision (range) altered (±3)
- 30% : Can grow or reduce in size (±2)
-   9% : Can change intelligence (dumb to smart or the contrary)
-   1% : Can change entity type (become another type)

You can modify the change for entities to mute in the options.
Deactivated by default.
All entities also other attributes.

Look for the informations below.
